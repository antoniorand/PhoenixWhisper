Software and automation are things of the present as well as the future.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.920
And me personally, I've wanted to be a part of that for a very long time.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.200
See, I started this channel to show you how you can do the same through code, right?

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.240
How you can build something real step-by-step and start thinking through how you can automate

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.240
things with software.

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.760
And I do it with more of a business flair. That's why the entrepreneurial side of things.

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.360
So what I hope that you do is subscribe and watch these tutorials.

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.880
But more importantly, I hope that you do them and do something with them.

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.480
Please let me know who you are. Tell me in the comments.

10
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.160
I would love to check out the things that you're working on and what you're doing as well

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.360
so we can all do this together because that's what it's all about.

12
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.200
That's what you do. It's what we do together as a community to build real things and solve

13
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.720
real problems.

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.720
Thanks so much.

15
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:28.680
I hope to see you in the series.
