The

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.980
jiles

3
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.420
Bear

4
00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:04.900
Jesus Christ.

5
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:20.100
May if you're looking for the Arabic option, go back to screen.

6
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.540
If you got a problem, what are you doing?

7
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.940
It's a cash point.

8
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.500
If you got a problem.

9
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.500
It's a cash point.

10
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.260
I know it's a cash point.

11
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.260
So what exactly is your problem?

12
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.260
It's not a fruit machine.

13
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Is it apple?

14
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.540
If you card in, then take your cash out.

15
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.700
What did you call me?

16
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.580
Two, arm and whatever.

17
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.220
Oh, scary.

18
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.220
You are, sis.

19
00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:03.700
You're going to chop me yet off.

20
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Are you done?

21
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:32.140
Bye-bye.

22
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.700
You know I'd like to introduce you to our CEO and founder, Samir Aziz.

23
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.460
OK, sure.

24
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.140
Just a quick hello to make you an official offer.

25
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.140
Sure.

26
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.980
You should fit in well here.

27
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.740
Thanks.

28
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.500
He's a lot.

29
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500
Give me two minutes.

30
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.820
I'll just see where he is.

31
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.820
Really good to have met you, Alistair.

32
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.540
Good luck.

33
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:18.980
Thanks.

34
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.620
He's not the finished article.

35
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.620
He's honest.

36
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.780
I'm keen to learn.

37
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.460
Yeah, I went off from the job.

38
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.460
OK.

39
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.020
What's going on?

40
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.220
Hi, Alistair.

41
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.220
I'm Samir.

42
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.060
Oh, good to meet you, Al.

43
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.860
Sorry, do we know each other?

44
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.860
Are you done, you know?

45
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.820
You seem so familiar.

46
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.820
Are you sure you don't know me?

47
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.820
I don't think so.

48
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:06.820
Oh, my God.

49
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.820
You're that guy.

50
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.820
Sorry?

51
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.820
That guy from the cash point.

52
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.820
I'm really sorry, I'm...

53
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.820
What the hell, Bremendia?

54
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.820
Sorry.

55
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:45.820
Mr. Aziz.

56
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.820
Sorry.

57
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:59.820
Do I know you?

58
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.820
Yeah.

59
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.820
You and if you'd been for a job I never got.

60
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.820
I don't think so.

61
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.820
You're as a guy.

62
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.820
Yeah, you did.

63
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.820
You had an office with, um,

64
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:21.820
so it green curtains, reindeer heads.

65
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.820
Yeah, that's right.

66
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.820
But it's been really difficult for us to be honest with you.

67
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.820
I'm waiting for a room and I sat at the a couple of weeks.

68
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.820
Just need to have time to go back to my feet.

69
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.820
I'm not going to give you that job.

70
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.820
I'm really sorry.

71
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.820
I don't remember.

72
00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:04.820
Don't worry, my hands fine.

73
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.820
Look, let me find a cash point.

74
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.820
You haven't checked him ever yet.

75
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.820
He's all so good at this, though.

76
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.820
He still needs a sheet of food, but my head's leaking,

77
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.820
I've got food for you today.

78
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.820
I'm always excited as I can sleep.

79
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.820
You'll get there at the Laaundieu.

80
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.820
I'm getting serious to waste.

81
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:37.820
I love you.

82
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.820
I love you.

83
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:49.820
I love you.

84
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.820
What?

85
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.820
I should tell you about the breakup of the week.

86
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.820
You sure, man?

87
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.820
Really?

88
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.820
Thank you.

89
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.820
Thank you so much.

90
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.820
Make today the first day everything wasn't the place where we were.

91
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.820
Well, I need so much.

92
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.820
Good luck.

93
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.820
We're coffee, son.

94
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:37.820
Thank you, Mr. Az.

95
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:47.820
I love you.

96
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:53.820
I love you.

97
00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:03.820
I love you.

98
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:11.820
I love you.

99
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.820
I love you.

100
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:28.820
I love you.

101
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.820
I love you.

102
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.820
I love you.

103
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.820
I love you.

104
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.820
Bye.

105
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.820
He's over.

106
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.820
He can process all the information.

107
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.820
He sees his, can think like you and me.

108
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.820
But he just finds it difficult to express himself.

109
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.820
But we're working on that.

110
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.820
I'll be with him.

111
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.820
Yes, that's good.

112
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.820
This is Alistair.

113
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.820
Alistair is a volunteer. He's here to help the residents.

114
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.820
You want a couple of minutes.

115
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.820
Yes, sure.

116
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.820
I'll leave you two together.

117
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.820
Alistair is lovely.

118
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.820
Any problems, just bars?

119
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.820
Sure.

120
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.820
Sammy?

121
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.820
My name's Alistair and I'm going to look after you.

122
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.820
Don't you worry about I think tomorrow morning.

123
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.820
We can go for a nice stroll in the garden.

124
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.820
Would you like that?

125
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:59.820
I'll take that as a yes.

126
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:07.820
Do I know you?

127
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:21.820
I know you.

128
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.820
I know you.

129
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.820
I know you.
