00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The biggest poison in us is regret.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I think there are a lot of people that have dreams

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and aspirations of things that they always wanted to do,

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but it wasn't the right time, where they didn't have enough money

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or they didn't have enough experience.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's never the right time.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You're never going to have the right experience.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And all of a sudden you wake up and you're 70.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And you're like, God, I wish I could have done it.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's what you don't do that screws with you later on.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I get one shot at this life.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is it.

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I don't want to go through life being the 80% version of me.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't want to look back and be like 77 and be like,

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I didn't do that.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There's so much I want to do and I love life so much.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I don't want to miss it.
